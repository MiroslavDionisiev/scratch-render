# scratch-render

WebGL-based rendering engine for Scratch 3.0

[![CI/CD](https://github.com/scratchfoundation/scratch-render/actions/workflows/ci-cd.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/scratchfoundation/scratch-render/actions/workflows/ci-cd.yml)

## Installation

```bash
npm install https://github.com/scratchfoundation/scratch-render.git
```

## Setup

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
    <head>
        <meta charset="UTF-8">
        <title>Scratch WebGL rendering demo</title>
    </head>

    <body>
        <canvas id="myStage"></canvas>
        <canvas id="myDebug"></canvas>
    </body>
</html>
```

```js
var canvas = document.getElementById('myStage');
var debug = document.getElementById('myDebug');

// Instantiate the renderer
var renderer = new require('scratch-render')(canvas);

// Connect to debug canvas
renderer.setDebugCanvas(debug);

// Start drawing
function drawStep() {
    renderer.draw();
    requestAnimationFrame(drawStep);
}
drawStep();

// Connect to worker (see "playground" example)
var worker = new Worker('worker.js');
renderer.connectWorker(worker);
```

## Standalone Build

```bash
npm run build
```

```html
<script src="/path/to/render.js"></script>
<script>
    var renderer = new window.RenderWebGLLocal();
    // do things
</script>
```

## Testing

```bash
npm test
```

## Committing

This project uses [semantic release](https://github.com/semantic-release/semantic-release) to ensure version bumps
follow semver so that projects depending on it don't break unexpectedly.

In order to automatically determine version updates, semantic release expects commit messages to follow the
[conventional-changelog](https://github.com/bcoe/conventional-changelog-standard/blob/master/convention.md)
specification.

Use the [commitizen CLI](https://github.com/commitizen/cz-cli) to make commits formatted in this way:

```bash
npm i -g commitizen cz-conventional-changelog
```

Now you're ready to make commits using `git cz`.
